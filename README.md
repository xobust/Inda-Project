## Setting up the project

### Local testing of back end code

To test the website locally so that back end stuff works, download [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
and clone the repo to `{Xampp install folder}/htdocs` (for example `C:/xampp/htdocs`). Start Xampp and press `Start` next to `Apache` and `MySQL`.
Change the settings in config.php and then run setup.php in you browser to setup the database.

### Setting up the IDE for the game
This project is built with [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) version 3.5 for [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
Community Edition 2015, running on Windows 10.
